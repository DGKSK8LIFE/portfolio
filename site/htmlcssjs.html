	<h1>My HTML, CSS and JavaScipt experience</h1>

	<p>10/05/2020: I already have some basic experience in HTML as I tried to make a website for the Aerospace Club at my school. After that, I didn't really do anything much in this language until I joined the HackClub, where learning front-end development is quite needed.</p> 

	<div id = "mySidenav" class="sidenav">
        <a href="index.html" id = "home"><button>Home</button></a>
        <a href="python.html" id = "python"><button>Python</button></a>
        <a href="c.html" id = "c"><button>C</button></a>
        <a href="htmlcssjs.html" id = "htmlcssjs"><button>HTML/CSS/JS</button></a>
        <a id = "dark"> <button onclick="toggleDarkMode()">Toggle dark mode</button></a>
    </div>

	<script type="text/javascript">
		function toggleDarkMode() {
			let element = document.body;
			element.classList.toggle("dark-mode");
		}
