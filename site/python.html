	<h1>My Python experience</h1>

	<p>Python is the first programming language I have ever learned. My computer science teacher introduced it to me in class in 7th grade, and I just simply loved the concept. I have learned the basics of the arithmetics as well as making loops, if statements. That is pretty much what I have learned so far in this language, and I do intent do increase my knowledge in this language. I have done some small projects, as a calculator, a dice, rock-papers-cisors, and I have done a small adventure game (text only) with my friend.</p>
