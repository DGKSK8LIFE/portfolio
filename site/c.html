	<h1>My C experience</h1>

	<p>10/05/2020: C is the second language I have gotten in to, by following a course from Dartmouth and IMT on edx. I have chosen to learn this language as most of other programmation languages are based on C, like Java, C++, C#, and plenty of more. Just as in Python, I  have learned basic arithmetics as well as loops, if statements, and arrays. </p>
